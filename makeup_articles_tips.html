            <h3>French Makeup Tutorial</h3>

            <p>
              When it comes to French makeup rules, it’s all about striking the
              right balance. A heavily-colored lip is balanced by neutral eyes,
              while dark eyeshadow is paired with a neutral lip color. French
              women like to keep it classy, and their goal is to achieve a
              healthy, natural-looking glow. You’ll never find their makeup
              looking cakey or stale. Here’s what you need to nail their look.

                Before you begin, cleanse your face and follow up with a toner.
                Apply a gentle moisturizer and a lip balm to make your face and
                pout look fresh and hydrated.

                Bobs are everywhere this summer! The only way to one up them is
                to slick down your bob just like Grace Vanderwaal. All you need
                is some mousse and a comb. Easy peasy! Also, if a side parting
                is not your style, try this look with a middle parting.

              />
              <p>
                Use a dewy concealer in a shade that matches your skin tone on
                areas that need coverage, like the under-eye area, spots, and
                redness. Blend it in thoroughly to achieve that natural,
                flawless coverage. French makeup is all about minimalism, so you
                don’t need to use brushes. Your fingers work just fine for this
                look.

              />
              <p>
                Gently dab a balmy highlighter with minimal shimmer on to your
                cheekbones, the bridge of your nose, Cupid’s bow, and the inner
                corners of your eyes to make your features really stand out. It
                also helps create an even, iridescent glow all over your face.
