            <h3>How To Apply Mascara – Tutorial With Pictures</h3>
            <p>
              Applying mascara can be a little intimidating, especially with the
              weird-looking applicators. But the tapered top and the stiff
              bristles of the mascara wand can help you reach every eyelash to
              give them a fuller appearance and make your eyes look big.
              However, the wrong application techniques can smudge the mascara
              and clump your eyelashes. The solution? Scroll through the
              following tutorial, and you will become a mascara pro in no time!
            </p>

              <li>Eyelash curler</li>

              />
              <p>
                Ensure the lashes do not have any trace of makeup. A clean base
                is always good to prevent clumping.
              </p>
            </div>

              />
              <p>
                Look straight and hold the lash curler at the base of your
                eyelashes (but not too close). Now, look down and gently press
                the eyelashes. Do it thrice as you move up towards the tip of
                your lashes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hack: Another way to curl your lashes is to place your index
                finger at the base of your lashes, look down, and hold them for
                6 seconds. Do this if you are uncomfortable using eyelash
                curlers.
              </p>

              />
              <p>
                Open the mascara tube and wipe off the excess product on the
                applicator. Look straight at the mirror and place the applicator
                at the base of your lashes. Move the applicator upwards to coat
                your eyelashes from the base to the tip. You can “wiggle” the
                applicator to ensure it coats the eyelashes uniformly.
              </p>
            </div>

              />
              <p>
                Now, the tricky part – coating the corners of your eyes. Use the
                applicator tip to cover the corner eyelashes. Coat them evenly
                from base to tip. This way, you will prevent smudging or
                transferring mascara.

              />

              <p>
                Comb your lashes down and then up with a spoolie brush or a lash
                comb to prevent clumping. Do it before the first coat of mascara
                dries completely.

                Enjoy the long and full lashes that give an illusion of false
                eyelashes! This mascara application technique works well for the
                upper lashes. But what about the lower lashes? Well, we have you
                covered! Here’s a quick tutorial on applying mascara to the
                lower lashes perfectly. Scroll down.

              <h1>How To Apply Mascara On The Lower Lashes (With Pictures)</h1>
              <p>
                The lower lashes tend to be shorter, finer, and sparser than the
                upper lashes. It is difficult to follow the same mascara
                application technique without smudging or transferring the
                product. Here’s an easy tutorial on how to apply mascara to the
                lower lashes like a pro.
              </p>

              />
              <p>
                Wipe off the excess mascara and apply it to the middle portion
                of your lower lashes.
              </p>
            </div>

              <h2>Step 3: Coat The Corner Lashes</h2>

              />
              <p>
                Coating the corner lashes can be tricky. Hold the wand
                vertically and use the tip to coat each lash in the inner and
                outer corners of your eyes. This technique works best for
                shorter or finer lashes on the lower eyelid.

              <p>
                Don’t your eyes look bigger and more open? In fact, your eyes
                also get an illusion of “lift” without using any other eye
                makeup product. For beginners, these two tutorials are a great
                way to practice and quickly master the mascara application
                technique. It works for all eye shapes and lashes. But most
                Asian eyelashes are harder to curl, even with mascara. So, what
                should you do if you have a monolid? Here’s a video with a
                life-changing mascara tip for beautiful Asian eyes.
