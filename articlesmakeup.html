              <h2>1. Make Sure Your Primer Complements Your Foundation.</h2>

              <p>
                Whether oil or water, your primer and foundation should share
                the same base; otherwise, they will repel each other or just
                slide off your face, making it difficult to blend.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>2. Make Crow’s Feet Disappear.</h2>
              <p>
                Dabbing a little amount of primer around your eyes dramatically
                minimizes the appearance of crow’s feet.
              </p>

            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>3. Right Application For Right Coverage.</h2>

              <p>
                While putting your foundation on, if you want sheer coverage,
                use your fingers. But, if you want a full coverage, use a
                foundation brush.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>4. Avoid Peach Fuzz.</h2>
              <img

              />
              <p>
                Always apply foundation using downward strokes. Most of us have
                a thin layer of hair on our face, and applying foundation in an
                upward stroke will make the hair strands stand out. Looking
                fresh and pink like a peach may be your goal, but highlighting
                your peach fuzz definitely shouldn’t be.

            <div>
              <h2>5. Create A Conical Shape.</h2>

              <p>
                Most of us are used to applying concealer in a semi-circular
                pattern under our eyes to reduce the appearance of the bags or
                puffiness. However, for best results, apply the concealer in a
                conical pattern under the eyes and extend it to almost where
                your nose ends. It not only does a better job at concealing
                because it is easy to blend, but it also helps in contouring the
                sides of your nose.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>6. DIY Color Correcting Palette</h2>

              <p>
                You probably, by now, have heard about the wonder called color
                correcting palette. These concealers of various hues are used to
                cancel out flaws on your face. For example, a green concealer is
                used for canceling out any redness, lavender for yellow toned
                discolouration, peach for bruises or blue toned under eye
                circles, etc. But if you suddenly find yourself without your
                color correction palette or just want to save money, just mix an
                eyeshadow of the color you want your concealer to be with your
                normal concealer – and voila! You have your smart and cheap
                color corrector concealer palette.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>7. Know The Important Focal Points.</h2>

              <p>
                This hack is for those days when you are running late or just
                feeling too lazy to apply your concealer properly. Just dab on a
                little concealer, preferably with a brush, under your eyes, on
                the corners of your mouth, and near your nose, and you are good
                to go.

              <h1>Face Powder Application Tips</h1>
              <img

            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>8. Know The Correct Function.</h2>

              <p>
                There are mainly two types of face powder – loose powder and
                pressed powder, and both come in dewy and matte finishes. It is
                important to know which one to use for what purpose. Loose
                powder is basically used to set the makeup in place and make it
                long-lasting. Though it comes in both tinted and translucent
                forms, it is best to use the colorless translucent one for
                setting the makeup as it will not disturb the color of your
                foundation and concealer. Pressed powder, however, is best
                suited for touch-ups on the go. Also, a dewy finish gives a
                glowing appearance to the skin, and a matte one provides a
                porcelain look with fine textures.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>9. Choose The Right Brush.</h2>

              <p>
                The result of any makeup product largely depends on the
                applicator, and this is especially true for powders. Always use
                the fluffiest brush you can find to put your powder on for best
                results.
              </p>
              <h1>Makeup Tips To Apply Blush</h1>
              <img
                src="https://cdn2.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Tips-For-Blush.jpg.webp"
              />
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>10. Blush Under Foundation.</h2>

              /> -->
              <p>
                This is also a clever way of reversing the order of applying the
                product to get smashing results. All you have to do is apply the
                blush first and then apply the foundation over it. The end
                result looks like you are glowing naturally from within.

            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>11. Use A Tissue Paper For Blotting.</h2>

              <p>
                Instead of blotting your blush with a powder, use a tissue
                paper. Press it lightly over the blush after application and
                finish off with your makeup sponge or beauty blender for that
                perfect flush of color on your cheeks.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>12. Be Careful With Shimmery Blushes.</h2>

              <p>
                It is tricky to pull off a shimmery blush perfectly. In fact, it
                is a good idea to skip shimmery blushes altogether if you have
                large pores, pimples or other symptoms of troubled skin.

              <h1>Makeup Tips To Apply Bronzer</h1>
              <img

              />
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>13. Apply In A Triangular Fashion For Better Blending.</h2>

              <p>
                Though it’s a common practice to apply bronzer with a fluffy
                brush on the hollow of your cheeks, it is a better idea to draw
                two inverted triangles on your cheeks with a bronzer. Blend it
                out, and you will have the perfectly done bronzer that will give
                you perfectly chiseled features.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>14. DIY Bronzer.</h2>

              <p>
                If you are in the mood for trying out something fun, try making
                your own bronzer. All you need are a few items that are already
                sitting on your kitchen shelf. Take some cinnamon powder, cocoa
                powder, some nutmeg powder, and mix with some cornstarch – and
                there you have your bronzer. If you are a fan of makeup with
                natural ingredients or want to keep chemicals completely at bay,
                it doesn’t get any more natural than this.
              </p>
              <h1>Makeup Tips For Brows</h1>

            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>15. Feathery Strokes.</h2>

              <p>
                Always use light feathery strokes while filling out your
                eyebrows with a pencil. It will make them look more natural.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>16. Instant Eye Lift.</h2>

              <p>
                For an instant lift in the eyes, use your highlighter just above
                the arch of your brows and blend it out. It will not only define
                your eyebrows perfectly but also have a dramatic impact on the
                appearance of your entire face.
              </p>

              <h2>17. Donning Many Hats.</h2>

              <p>
                This is one of the most versatile soldiers of your makeup
                arsenal. Eyeshadow can be used as a blush, bronzer, highlighter
                and even to slightly alter the color of your base makeup items.
              </p>
            </div>

              <h2>18. Get The Pop.</h2>

              />
              <p>
                If you are stuck with an eyeshadow with less pigment or you want
                that extra pop of color, create a white base by filling in your
                eyelids with a white eyeliner pencil first.

            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>19. Proxy For Eyeliner.</h2>

              <p>
                On the days when another battle with your eyeliner seems
                impossible or you just want a soft look, take an angular brush
                and use eyeshadow instead of an eyeliner on your upper lash
                line. It gives a natural and breezy look, absolutely perfect for
                summers.

              <h2>20. Dots And Dashes To The Rescue.</h2>

              <p>
                It might sound lame to a few, but there are people (like me) for
                whom drawing a straight line on paper is a task difficult
                enough, let alone exhibit such mastery on eyes with an eyeliner.
                Fret not, just draw small dots or dashes with your eyeliner on
                the lashline and join them. Perfectly done eyeliner in a jiffy.

              <p>
                Bobs are everywhere this summer! The only way to one up them is
                to slick down your bob just like Grace Vanderwaal. All you need
                is some mousse and a comb. Easy peasy! Also, if a side parting
                is not your style, try this look with a middle parting.

            <div>
              <h2>21. Scotch Tape Method.</h2>

              <p>
                For a perfect wing, use the scotch tape method. Just stick a
                scotch tape in an angular fashion on the sides of your eyes and
                let the ends guide you to achieve that killer winged eyeliner
                every single time. You can also use a spoon, business card,
                debit card or basically anything with a straight edge as a
                guide.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h2>23. Go Natural With Tightlining.</h2>

              <p>
                Try tightlining for the perfect no makeup look. Instead of
                putting the eyeliner on the lashline, apply it beneath the line.
                Make sure you use a waterproof variant for this one.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>24. Use A Shadow To Lock It In.</h2>

              <p>
                Use an eyeshadow of the same shade as the eyeliner to set the

                Bobs are everywhere this summer! The only way to one up them is
                to slick down your bob just like Grace Vanderwaal. All you need
                is some mousse and a comb. Easy peasy! Also, if a side parting
                is not your style, try this look with a middle parting.

              <p>
                When it comes to smudge prevention, kajal is not the easiest
                product to work with. However, to ensure your kajal stays put
                for hours, simply dab some eyeshadow over it once you are done.
                You can also use an eyeliner. Simply draw a line with the liner
                over your kajal. It will lock the kajal in place and also look
                super neat.

                Q-tip into a cleansing lotion and carefully remove the kajal
                with it. Avoid poking yourself in the eyes.

                Know your color tone. There are basically three tones – warm,
                cool and neutral, and it is important to know yours to find
                makeup products that have undertones to suit your color tone. An
                easy way to tell which tone you are is to check the color of
                your veins. If you have bluish or purplish veins, you have a
                cool tone. If they appear green, you have a warm tone, and if
                you have trouble telling, you are probably of a neutral tone.

                favorite perfume. However, don’t empty the bottle on yourself.
                If it’s a strong fragrance, instead of directly spraying it,
                spray it above your head, a little away from your body, and walk
                into the mist. It will distribute the fragrance evenly and
                linger on.

                are always only a few colors that we use. Palettes are usually

                products you will actually use. It can save you a lot of money
