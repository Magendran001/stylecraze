          <h1>The Best Lighting For Makeup Application</h1>
          <p>March 28, 2022 Written by Esha Saxena</p>
          <p>
            Be it makeup professionals or stylists – all beauty experts believe
            that proper lighting is crucial to their success. As a result, they
            spend a significant portion of their operating budget on
            high-quality lighting for makeup application. Therefore, lighting
            should be a vital component of your makeup toolkit. Without
            appropriate lighting, you may use colors that lose their vibrancy
            and wash out your complexion. In addition, the proper lighting may
            make a huge difference in how well you apply your makeup. Lastly,
            you need proper lighting during makeup application to make sure you
            do the right makeup for the event and don’t look over or under made
            up. In this article, we have narrowed down just what you need to do
            the most flawless makeup looks and put your most beautiful face
            forward. Keep reading to know more!

            <h3>Natural Daylight Is The Perfect Lighting</h3>

            <p>
              Even makeup artists agree that natural daylight is undeniably the
              best lighting for makeup application as it provides the most
              accurate reflection of your face. Moreover, natural light is clear
              and evenly diffused, so you can easily point out when something is
              not blended properly. If you have the option of doing your makeup
              by your window, take full advantage of it. Natural daylight will
              give you the accuracy and precision that you need for a flawless
              base.

                You don’t always have the luxury of doing your makeup in the
                comfort of natural daylight. What you can do instead is invest
                in daylight bulbs that mimic natural light. We recommend GE
                Reveal LED 40W Light Bulbs as they filter out yellow light to
                give you ultra clear colors. They are also dimmable, so you can
                adjust the intensity according to your needs. You can also see
                what your makeup looks like in different settings. Installing a
                couple of daylight bulbs in your bathroom or around your makeup
                mirror is a great way to ensure you never end up with unblended
                concealer, heavy bronzer, or raccoon eyes.

              <h3>The Position Of Your Light Matters Too</h3>

              <p>
                Makeup artists suggest that lighting should hit your face evenly
                – from the sides, bottom, and top. For best results, position
                your light source to shine on your face from the front. Overhead
                lighting or lighting from below casts bad shadows. This is a big
                no-no because you will end up putting on way too much makeup. If
                you can’t change your room lighting, you can invest in a makeup
                mirror with natural white lights, like the Gotofine LED Lighted
                Vanity Mirror. Now, you must be wondering what kind of lighting
                you need to avoid when putting on your makeup. Scroll down to
                find out!

              <h3>
                The Lighting You Should Absolutely Avoid When Applying Makeup
              </h3>

              <p>
                It’s best to steer clear of fluorescent, yellow, and
                rose-colored lights. Fluorescent lights have the tendency to
                wash out your skin while enhancing your flaws, thus making you
                go heavy on the makeup. On the other hand, yellow and
                rose-colored lights are flattering, but they make it hard to
                really see what colors you’re using or how well you’re blending
                the products. Ladies, good lighting plays the most crucial role
                in how your makeup eventually looks. You don’t want to apply
                your makeup in a dimly lit room and then be in for a rude shock
                when you see yourself in a garishly lit bathroom – it’s a
                nightmare! We hope this article helps you stay flawless, so you
                never suffer from mid-day makeup remorse ever again. What type
                of lighting do you do your makeup in? Let us know in the
                comments section below.
